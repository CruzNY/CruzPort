  <h3 class="subtitle">How I came about, my interests and goals.</h3>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="has-text-centered">My name is Alexis Cruz and I am currently a senior at the New York City College of Technology
      majoring in Computer Systems. I've been using a computer since I was 6, but in recent years I've
      become a power user and it has become an extension of me.I didn't start off in CS, I was
      originally electrical engineering until one summer in Mexico, my cousin who was entering college
      showed me mechatronics and I fell in love the programming aspect. A lot of the conpects such as
      classes, inheritence and overloading/overriding came naturally to me since my thought process
      worked in a similar way. After that vacation I decided to persue Computer Systems.
      My school's software development track revolves around Java, so that is my primary language.
      I like writing applications and working with databases. Away from school I like
      solving problems on HackerRank or LeetCode and writting automated data entry scripts with
      Python, but also building websites such as this one.

      My future goals is to one day move out to Silicon Valley and work at one of many big tech
      companies there. Possibly one day even work or have my very own startup. I'm still young
      so for the foreseable future I want to work with dedicated and passionate people that
      build together into soemthing great!</p>

      Both framework's concepts are easy to follow and really make it easy for the developer to get projects started and running.
      This website is still in development, the more i learn the more features get added to this website.
